# Assignment 2: Review of programming report

## Completeness of concepts list

Excellent, 7 listed concepts.

## Discussion of concepts: technical background

Average. Good examples on how the concepts can be accessed in C code and how they are manifested in hardware, but content is a bit sparse.

## Discussion of concepts: impact on implementation

Excellent, for all concepts it is clear how different implementations can affect the implementation of the program.

## Clarity of program layout

Excellent. Nice flowchart! Some comments:

* Should each writer thread only compute Newton's method for a single row? This is unclear from the text.
* How does the main thread communicate to the writer threads which rows to compute?

## Resolution of subtasks

Excellent. Small subtasks that are easy to understand.

## Final words

To me, the description of the program layout seems like a particular strong point of the report. It was very easy to understand the indended program layout from the flowchart, and the following text also gave me a good idea of how the program is split up into subtasks.

I couldn't really think of any improvements of the implementation. Good work!
