# Assignment 2: Review of programming report

## Completeness of concepts list

Excellent, 4 listed concepts.

## Discussion of concepts: technical background

Excellent, for each concept it is described how it can be accessed in C code and how it manifests in hardware.

## Discussion of concepts: impact on implementation

Average. For some of the concepts it could be clearer how the implementation is affected.

## Clarity of program layout

Excellent.

## Resolution of subtasks

Average. The description of how the main tasks can be split up into subtasks could be clearer. Right now, it feels more like each program line has been described in text, and not which subtasks the code will be split up into.

## Final words

To me, the description of the relevant concepts seems like a particular strong point of the report. All the descriptions were short, concise and easy to understand. Although in some cases it was not entirely clear how the implementation would be affected.

I couldn't really think of any improvements of the implementation. Good work!
